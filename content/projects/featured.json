		"description": "This project implements a deep learning model for reflection removal from images. Developed during VisionX Hackathon (Qualcomm), our model enhances image quality by eliminating unwanted reflections using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of images with and without reflections, allowing it to learn the patterns and features associated with reflections. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques, our model effectively restores the original appearance of images, making it a valuable tool for photographers, videographers, and anyone working with visual content. The project showcases our expertise in deep learning, computer vision, and image processing, and highlights our commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology.",

		"description": "Humsafari is a travel planner chatbot developed to make planning trips super easy. Recently I wanted to plan my trip to some place but i couldn't find any website that helped me to do the pure planning part. that is where this idea came to me. this website acts like a friend who is planning a trip except for the fact that he is all-knowing chatbot. I have developed humsafari with the idea that it will help one to plan a complete trip A-Z. Humsafar is hindi means travel companion, therefore I built this Chatbot with the vision that this chatbot should help the traveler for the planning stage to the completion of the trip. Humsafari is a travel planner, developed by me.",
